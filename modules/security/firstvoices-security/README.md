# FirstVoicesSecurity

## Module Description
This module adds and handles security policies within FirstVoices by setting up some custom permissions (e.g. Record) and applying custom security policies.
In addition, it overrides the default Nuxeo login page to use a custom FirstVoices login page (JSF).

## ToDo
* Move various non-security operations from this module
* Retire JSF login page as soon as SSO is configured
