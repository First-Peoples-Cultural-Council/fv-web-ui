# FVUserRegistration

## Module Description
This module handles user registration and approval in FirstVoices, allowing people to sign-up and join a dialect.

## ToDo
* Rename package to be consistent with other packages (consider moving to shorter names, e.g. `fv-*`)
* Consider refactoring/renaming to handle user management in general
* Retire some logic as soon as SSO is configured to handle it
