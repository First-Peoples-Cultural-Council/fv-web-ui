# FirstVoicesExport

## Module Description
This module provides the ability to export words and phrases in a CSV format using workers.
It is not currently being used by the front-end due to FW-1037. 

## ToDo
* Consider refactoring as FirstVoicesIO (to handle input and output in multiple formats)
* Fix bug FW-1037 (blocking launch on Preprod), or deprecate module
* Assess whether bulk operations can be an alternative to this module with Nuxeo 10.10
