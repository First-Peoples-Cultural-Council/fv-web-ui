# FirstVoicesEnrichers

## Module Description
This module supplements responses in FirstVoices with additional data regarding objects (enrichment).
For example, it will expand audio IDs to audio objects on a word in order to make that data available within one request to a word.

## ToDo
* Move CRUD operations from this module (including queries)
* Implement marshalling where possible
* Assess whether `enricher` logic should be moved to other module (e.g. FirstVoicesOperations)
