import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

/*
NOTE: ODD MYSTERY

For some reason, when this file imports:
`import { directoryReducer } from './directory'`

Any component that imports `fetchDirectory` will get `undefined`, eg:
`import { fetchDirectory } from 'providers/redux/reducers/directory'`

To sidestep this issue I duplicated `./directory` > `./_directory`
and it seems to work (but both files need to be in place!)

Components importing `fetchDirectory`:
  1) javascripts/views/components/Editor/DirectoryList.js
  2) javascripts/views/components/SearchDialect/index.js
