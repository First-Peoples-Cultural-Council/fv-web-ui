1) Create an operation that will return all of the categories for a specific dialect
  - Operation will take in a dialect document
  - Will return all of the categories for that dialect


  In Nuxeo ALMOST EVERYTHING IS A DOCUMENT.

2) Write some unit tests
  - Make sure that, if a dialect has categories, it returns categories for that dialect
    - INPUT: DIALECT
    - OUTPUT: LIST OF CATEGORIES
  - Make sure that, if another dialect has categories, and my input is a different dialect, I don't see those categories
    - INPUT: A DIFFERENT DIALECT
    - OUTPUT: EITHER THE INPUT DIALECT'S CATEGORIES OR MAYBE NOTHING IF MAYBE PERMISSIONS?
  - What happens when the dialect has no categories?
    -INPUT: DIALECT
    -OUTPUT: NULL, EMPTY LIST
  - What happens in this case:
    -INPUT: NOT A DIALECT
    -OUTPUT: ? SOME SORT OF EXCEPTION
