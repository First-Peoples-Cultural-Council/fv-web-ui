# migration-contributions

## Module Description
This module handles migrating `trash` services due to the change in Nuxeo introducing `ecm:isTrashed` (from `ecm:currentLifecycleState = 'deleted'`).
This should be removed as still as the ToDo below is done.

## ToDo
* Determine if this is still needed ([follow steps here](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/trash-service/#trash-migration))
